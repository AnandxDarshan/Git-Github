Different ways of syncing with what's on the remote (github) to our local hard drive:
----------------------

1> Clone:
--------
	- git clone
	- get's a copy of the remote repo and places it onto the local hard drive.


2> Fetch:
--------
	- git fetch
	- if we already have a copy, but want to sync with the remote for any changes or additions then we use this.
	- it doesn't actually does anything with the content, but sync to keep the repo info update on the local machine.
	- like if we created branch on github, we will have fetched the branch from remote to local.

3> Pull:
-------
	- git pull
	- this  is the combination of doing fetch and the merging the contents that's been found in the info (from the fetch ) from remote to local repo.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation:

> Cloning:

	git clone link
		link: we can find the link from github repo's code button. copy and paste it at link's place.
		- this link is really just the url for the repo with .git extention. 
------------------

> Fetching:

	git fetch
		- git branch
			- will show the local branches.

		- git branch -a
			- will show the local + remote branches.

------------------

> pulling:
	
	git pull
		- will fetch(sync) and download.
		- sometimes it might ask you to first --set-upstream i.e., to link of the default remote branch for the local branch. by default every pull sets the master as default remote branch.

------------------

additional:
		
	git push --all
		- to push local changes to all the remote branches, and not just into master branch.
		
------------------
