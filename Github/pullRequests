Pull Requests:
------------

-> this is how users ask for the changes to be made on the main site.


steps:
	- let's edit a file on the github repo.
	- after changing, we move to Preview changes from Edit file.
	- there we get what we've modified and then
	- there's an option to commit those changes, 
	- you can provide message for the commit and even a longer description.
	- now at the end you'll have two options to choose from to commit:
		<*> commit directly to the main branch.
		<*> create a new branch for the commit and start a pull request.

-------------
	-> the second option generates a pull request.

	- purpose changes.
	- opens a pull request
	- Create pull request.
--- and there we created a pull request.

next we see:
	changename followed by the #number ( of pull request).

	- there kinda like discussin goes on, the change etc.
	- we can ask for opinion and then let other people make comments on it.
	
-------------
	-Once we're done with the  pull request change, we can Merge the pull request.
	- we confirm merge.
	- then we get prompt saying: pull request successfully merged and closed.

------------- and that is the whole process of creating and merging a pull request and closing it.

----------------------------------------

additional settings(project management tools) on the right side of the window:

 -> Assignees:
	- we can add assignees, with different works.

 -> Labels:
	- we can add labels for specific topics, ask for helps through use.

 -> Milestones:
	- let's u define targets that you want to achieve with the code.

 -> Linked Issues:
	- Issues ( i.e., that is defining a task to someone in the project ) can be linked with a pull request 
	- so if someone does the change and look into the issue, the pull request automatically closes as it's been looked into.

-------------

	commits section:
		- shows all changes.
		- pretty cool and handy feature.


That is roughly all on pull request.
