-> Organizing Projects:

	Managing Projects tools on github:
----------------------------------------
		* contributors

		* Issues: notes created and shared with others usually to fix a thing in the project.

		* Labels: one of the ways issues can be organized is through labels. we can add multiple labels.

		* Milestones: are grouping issues for a goal that needs to be achieved.
		
		* Projects: a way to see the progress  and see how well are the goals accomplished.

----------------------------------------

Issues
Milestone ( can show single issue progress or grouped issue ).
