 Github Options:

markdown (.md extention) - when you edit files on github, then it uses this mode.

-----------------
we can even add files directly in the github repo with the option add files.
	which has two options:
		- upload files
		- create new file 
			* which will give us an option of creating sub directories too, we will write the name followed by / to create a sub directory for the same.
	
	for eg.>
		consider we have a repo names Prime/ we will write sub/ to create sub directory and then we can then finally add the file.

----------------

--> Tags:
_______
	- which will make our repo searchable on github if set to public.
	
----------------
About section: for the description of the repo project.

website: we can even add site link if we have made a website for the project.

Topics: again a way of how we make the repo searchable. like if our project was based on html, css and javaScript. then we will write those in here, seperate with a comma, to make it as a tag.

then there are other options in there too.


----------------

-->> Issues:
____________
	It's kind of like to-do .
	we can create a to-do task and then assign it to an individual developer or the member of the project team.
	A way to coolaborate.

------------------

-->> Pull Requests:
_________________
	- pull requests are useful for approving somebody else's changes .
	- we can also use this to compare different branches.

------------------

-->> Actions:
__________
	- test codes, or send codes to where it will be hosted automatically.
	- sort of a way of managing the repo.
	- we can even download services shown below to perform actions.

	- extremely advance, hence don't mess with it as beginner.

------------------

-->> Projects:
____________
	- where we can manage the code that is being used.

------------------

-->> wiki:
	- it kinda creates documentation of the project, but it isn't that advance or tricky, it is very simple and that's why not used much.
	- generally documentation is created separately.

-------------------

-->> Security:
	- manage policies for security.
	- sort of advance, don't mess much with it yet.

-------------------

-->> Insights:
	- pretty handy, lets us see the amount of contribution a person has made into the project , shows traffic, shows commits, code frequency, dependancy graphs ( shows what tools the project is using and depends on ), Network, Forks.

-------------------

-->> Settings:
	there a crazy number of settings in this.
	- we can add a template refering current repo, which can be used later in other projects.

	- we can even add image to our project.
	- we can even turn features off and on for the repo.
	- there's other things, advanced so leaving for now.
	
	one imp section in the settings:
		* Pages:
			- designed to let u host website through your repository.
			- so we can host simple sites using the repo.
			- we can choose the level to host ( i.e., the /root or other directories ).
			
			- as soon as it is hosted. it shows a url that you can follow, note that it might take some time.
		
			- even though the repo will be private the site will be public.
		

			- there's one service called, jackle, which let's create the site more easily.

------------------

so yeah we can host stuffs for free through github and that's cool. Lots of developers use that.
