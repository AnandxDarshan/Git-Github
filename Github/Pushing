Pushing to Github:
	

--------------------------------------------

--> Remotes:

	git remote add name url
		# git remote remove name  // removes the remote
		# git rename oldname newename  // rename remote
		# git remote -v  // lists all the remotes with verbose.

	-> hosting repo to a remote repo.
	-> a very common name for the remote that we use is "origin"

	-> so we may see that we are pushing to origin, and we are assigning the URL to the origin name.
	
	-> we can add as many remote locations as possible to push our works at multiple places.
	
	-> so we can add more than one remotes.

----------------------------------

 > Git Push:

	git push remote branch
		# git push --set-upstream-to origin main(master)
		git push -u origin main # --set-upstream ( used for the first push )

		# git push -all // to push every branch
		# git branch --set-upstream-to <origin/remote-branch>  // sometimes git push -all tell us to manually push for individual branch so we use this .

---------------------------------
implementation:
	after having creating a repo on github, either manually or using gh CLI (linux utility),

		git remote add origin repo_url.git

		git push -all
			- pushes all the branches and stuffs.
		
		git push -u origin main(master)
			- if you only want to push main or master branch ( or one of other branch only ) and the changes in it.
