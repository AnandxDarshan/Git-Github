	- revert sign and etc


git log --oneline
	-> shows one line log commits, makes it less longer.

git diff hashValue
	-> gonna show the difference by comparing the latest commit with the the commit of hashValue ( hashValue can be taken form the git log or git log --oneline command ).


gitlense is the extension for replacing the diff command.
