In case of other developer bringing change in the remote repo.
you'll have to fetch and pull and then merge it . Then you'll be able to push your change to the remote repo.

to do that:

	git fetch -u origin main( or master)
		- required for the first time only.
		- git fetch should work

	git pull

	git merge

	if there's no commit made locally, first make a commit"
	
	git commit -m "any message"

	then
	git push

and we will be good.
