# git config command

git config --global user.name "github Username"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"

global option makes sure that every project will use same name and email address.

# Initializing projects
once git is configured, next step is to initialize a project.
i.e., to prepare the folder that is going to hold the project.

git init

this would have initialized a project, and would have created a .git hidden directory too. we cd .git to check how git maintains the project.

-----------------

# Staging Files

git add filename
	# git add --all 
	# git add -A // same as -all option
	# git add .

So staging is temperary area that we can store files that we want to commit later on.

git commit -m "first commit"
	-m : short message related to the commit.
	- tells git that's a checkpoint that we want to track for project.
	- That way we can come back to it later.
------------------

#to verify:
	git log
	- to see and verify (by looking at the -m message that we write while commiting) if the git is keeping track of the commit or not.
