# git config command

git config --global user.name "github Username"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"

global option makes sure that every project will use same name and email address.

# Initializing projects
once git is configured, next step is to initialize a project.
i.e., to prepare the folder that is going to hold the project.

git init

this would have initialized a project, and would have created a .git hidden directory too. we cd .git to check how git maintains the project.

-----------------

# Staging Files

git add filename
	# git add --all
	# git add -A
	# git add .

git commit -m "first commit"

So staging is temperary area that we can store files that we want to commit later on.
