Deleting:
	
1> manual

2> git rm index.html
	-> staging for index.html deletion
	-> then comitting will remove the file.

	> to restore:
		git restore -S index.html
			-S -> for staging


Renaming:

	-> if we rename a file to something else manually, git will consider the file with the old name deleted, and new file with the new name created.

	-> so we when restore the previous, we will not be seeing that the file with old name appeared but the same file with the new name has stayed.


like linux: renaming uses mv
	git mv index.html home.html
		-> renames the index.html to home.html
