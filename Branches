Branches:
	- lets us creat different versions of the code, so that we test implement different features without messing up the stable and original one.

-->git branch
	- lets us see all the branches in the repo.
	- our repo for now just have one (master or main)

---------------

Copying a branch:

--> git switch -c name
			# git checkout -b name // older version of the same command.
	-> creates and switches to a new branch.
		- the branch is the copy of exact state of the previous working branch.
