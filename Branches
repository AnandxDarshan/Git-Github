Branches:
	- lets us creat different versions of the code, so that we test implement different features without messing up the stable and original one.

-->git branch
	- lets us see all the branches in the repo.
	- our repo for now just have one (master or main)

---------------

Copying a branch:

--> git switch -c name
			# git checkout -b name // older version of the same command.
	-> creates and switches to a new branch.
		- the branch is the copy of exact state of the previous working branch.

---------------

Now we need to synchronize the new branch with the main(master) branch: we need to know about merging.

> Merging:
---------

--> merge command will merge the changes from the main branch to the current branch.

--> git merge <branch>
	- will merge the current branch with the changes in the <branch>.

git switch name
	-> to switch to the other branch. (name branch) eg. git switch master

--------------
> Deleting branch

	When we are done with a branch and merged the change into main ( if we want to ), it is good practice to delete the branch.

--> git branch --delete name
			# git branch -d name
			# git branch -D name

---------------

>> Git flow:
-----------
this is a general pattern that we followed:
		* feature/fix branch
		* make changes
		* merge to master
		* delete old branch
